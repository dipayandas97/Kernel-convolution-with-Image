# Kernel-convolution-with-Image
The python program convolves an input image with a kernel/filter of input size and element. 
The flower.jpg is used as the input image and karnal of 
[[-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,8,-1],
 [-1,-1,-1]]
 is used as a test karnal to yield the attached results as result.jpg and figure-1. jpg. 
 The test kernel does edge detection but the elements can be changed to do produce other effects like blue etc also.
